### 4. [Chain.cpp](https://github.com/SPHINX-HUB-ORG/SPHINX-HUB/blob/main/src/Chain.cpp)

Supports various operations like adding blocks, transferring funds between chains and shards, performing atomic swaps, and handling bridge transactions. Let's focus on the key functions and their purposes:

- addBlock: This function adds a new block to the blockchain. Before adding the block, it verifies the block's validity using a public key (SPHINXPubKey). If the block is valid, it is added to the chain.

- transferFromSidechain: This function transfers a block from a sidechain to the main chain. It first verifies the block's validity using a public key (SPHINXPubKey). If valid, the block is added to the main chain.

- handleBridgeTransaction: This function handles a bridge transaction, which involves transferring funds from one chain to another. It validates the transaction and, if valid, adds it to the target chain.

- performAtomicSwap: This function performs an atomic swap between the current chain and a target chain. Atomic swaps allow two parties to exchange assets atomically without the need for a trusted third party. The function verifies the validity of the transactions and balances before executing the swap.

- toJson and fromJson: These functions are used to convert the chain data to and from JSON format for storage and communication.

- getBalance and updateBalance: These functions manage the balances of addresses on the chain.

- createShard, joinShard, and transferToShard: These functions are used to create and manage shards, which are separate chains connected to the main chain.

- performShardAtomicSwap: This function performs an atomic swap between the current shard and a target shard.

The code is designed to be interoperable, meaning it supports interactions between different chains and shards through functions like transferFromSidechain, handleBridgeTransaction, and performShardAtomicSwap. It is also scalable as it supports the creation and management of multiple shards, allowing for better resource utilization and transaction processing.


### 5. [Chainmanager.cpp](https://github.com/SPHINX-HUB-ORG/SPHINX-HUB/blob/main/src/ChainManager.cpp)

The Chain Manager acts as the central hub for blockchain management, providing functionalities for chain synchronization, conflict resolution, and chain selection. It ensures that all nodes in the network have the most up-to-date and consistent view of the blockchain. When conflicts or forks occur, the Chain Manager applies consensus rules to determine the longest valid chain, resolving any discrepancies and maintaining the blockchain's single source of truth.

In "ChainManager.cpp," you will find code for handling incoming blocks from the network, verifying their validity, and incorporating them into the local blockchain. It coordinates with other components, such as the Block Manager and Consensus Mechanism, to achieve network-wide consensus and ensure the blockchain's security and integrity.

The proper functioning of "ChainManager.cpp" is crucial to the stability and trustworthiness of the SPHINX-HUB blockchain. It plays a pivotal role in maintaining a unified and consistent view of the blockchain across all nodes, supporting the network's decentralization and facilitating secure and transparent transactions.

1. Generating address:
SPHINX addresses are derived from a public key through a series of cryptographic transformations.
A checksum is added to the address to provide a way of verifying its validity.
The address includes both the public key and the checksum.


2. Address verification:
- When a user wants to send funds to a SPHINX address, the recipient provides the address to the sender.
- The sender uses the address to validate the checksum.
- The checksum is recalculated from the address (excluding the existing checksum), and it should match the original checksum provided by the recipient.
- If the checksums match, the sender can be confident that the address is valid and funds will be sent to the intended recipient.

3. Error prevention:
- If the address is mistyped or contains errors, the checksum verification will fail, preventing the sender from sending funds to an incorrect or non-existent address.
- This helps reduce the risk of funds being lost due to human error.

The `Key.cpp` and `Hybrid_Key.cpp` leverages Post-Quantum Public-key Encryption and Key-establishment Algorithms [Crystals-kyber](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/post-quantum-cryptography-standardization/round-3-submissions) as round-3 post-quantum winners.

In the thrilling era of quantum computers, where we find ourselves in a `Super Position` between classical and quantum realms, the choice of a hybrid key exchange scheme combining curve448 and Kyber1024 holds immense significance. Let's explore why this combination is the perfect fit.

1. Embracing the Best of Both Worlds: `curve448`, a battle-tested and widely adopted algorithm, provides a solid foundation of proven security and efficient key generation. On the other hand, `Kyber1024` represents the cutting-edge of post-quantum cryptography, designed to resist attacks from powerful quantum computers. By combining these two exceptional algorithms, we enter a "Super Position" where we benefit from the strengths of both classical and quantum-resistant cryptography.

2. Inspiration from Tech Giants: The widespread adoption of `curve448` and `Kyber1024` by the larger tech community serves as our guiding light and inspiration. These algorithms have garnered trust and confidence from experts and industry leaders, paving the way for their integration into our hybrid scheme. By following in the footsteps of these role models, we embrace a solution that is not only innovative but also aligns with industry best practices.

In this era of immense technological possibilities, the combination of `curve448` and `Kyber1024` in a hybrid key exchange scheme symbolizes our readiness to face the challenges presented by quantum computing. It demonstrates our commitment to leverage the proven track record of `curve448` and the promising resilience of `Kyber1024`. Together, these algorithms empower us to navigate the quantum landscape with confidence, ensuring the security and longevity of our cryptographic systems.

**Description and logic**;
- `Curve448` given 224-bit security level
- `Kyber-1024` given (equal AES-256) mean 256-bit security level
If we `merged` them it means we will achieve security level nearly `480-bytes`, this not lightweight but more secured


**Functions**;

- The code defines a function called `performX448KeyExchange` that performs the `curve448` key exchange given a private key, public key, and a buffer to store the shared key.

- It defines a structure called `HybridKeypair`, which holds the merged key pair consisting of a `Kyber1024` key pair and and `curve448` key pair, as well as PKE key pair, and a random number generator.

- The function `generate_hybrid_keypair` generates a hybrid key pair by generating a `Kyber1024` key pair, an `curve448` key pair, and a PKE key pair using appropriate functions. It returns the generated hybrid key pair.

- The function `deriveMasterKeyAndChainCode` is used to derive a master private key and chain code from a given seed using the `HMAC-SHA512` function. It returns the `derived master private key` and `chain code` as a pair.

- There are several utility functions defined, such as `deriveKeyHMAC_SHA512` to derive a key using `HMAC-SHA512`, `hashSWIFFTX512` to calculate the `SWIFFTX-512` hash of data, and `generateRandomNonce` to generate a random nonce.

- The function `deriveKeyHKDF` derives a key using the `HKDF` (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function) algorithm with `SHA256` as the default hash function.

- The function hash calculates the `SWIFFTX-256` hash of a given input.

- The function `generateKeyPair` generates a random private key and calculates the corresponding public key by hashing the private key.

- The function `generateAddress` generates an address from a given public key by hashing the public key and taking the first 20 bytes of the hash.

- The function `requestDigitalSignatur`e requests a digital signature for a given data using the provided hybrid key pair.

- The functions `encryptMessage` and `decryptMessage` are used to encrypt and decrypt a message, respectively, using the `Kyber1024` KEM (Key Encapsulation Mechanism).

- The functions `encapsulateHybridSharedSecret` and `decapsulateHybridSharedSecret` are used to encapsulate and decapsulate a shared secret using the `hybrid KEM`, which combines `curve448` and `Kyber1024`.

This code provides a set of functions and structures to support hybrid key generation, key exchange, encryption, decryption, and other cryptographic operations.


**The interaction and collaboration between Key.cpp and Hybrid_Key.hpp**

1. **SPHINXKey Namespace** interacts with the **SPHINXHybridKey Namespace** by calling the function `generate_hybrid_keypair` from the `SPHINXHybridKey` namespace. This function generates the hybrid keypair and its corresponding private and public keys.

2. The function `SPHINXKey::generateAddress` uses the `SPHINXHybridKey::SPHINXHash::SPHINX_256` function to hash the public key and generate an address based on the hash. This address is used for smart contract identification.

3. In `SPHINXHybridKey::generate_hybrid_keypair`, Kyber1024 and X448 keypairs are generated. The function also derives a master private key and chain code using HMAC-SHA512 from a seed value and then derives private and public keys from the master key and chain code using HMAC-SHA512.

4. The `SPHINXHybridKey` namespace provides functions to encrypt and decrypt messages using Kyber1024 for KEM (Key Encapsulation Mechanism).

5. The `SPHINXHybridKey::performX448KeyExchange` function performs the X448 key exchange.

6. The `SPHINXHybridKey` namespace also includes functions to encapsulate and decapsulate shared secrets using the hybrid KEM, combining the results of Kyber1024 and X448.

**Combined Usage**:
The combined usage of `SPHINXKey` and `SPHINXHybridKey` allows for the generation of secure hybrid keypairs that leverage the strengths of both Kyber1024 and X448 cryptographic algorithms. The hybrid keypairs can be used for various cryptographic purposes, including encryption, decryption, and key exchange, making it a versatile and robust cryptographic solution.

**NOTATION**;
The next roadmap as consideration for long term security guarantee is to completely implement Homomorphic-Hybrid key generation scheme in the [Tfhe.cpp](https://github.com/SPHINX-HUB-ORG/SPHINX-HUB/blob/main/src/Tfhe.cpp) as protocol to leverage [TFHE](https://github.com/SPHINX-HUB-ORG/SPHINX-HUB/tree/main/src/Lib/Master-Lib/tfhe-master) library to achieve homomorphic and hybrid key generation at once.


### 11. [Mempool.cpp](https://github.com/SPHINX-HUB-ORG/SPHINX-HUB/blob/main/src/Mempool.hpp)

### 12. [Merkleblock.cpp](https://github.com/SPHINX-HUB-ORG/SPHINX-HUB/blob/main/src/MerkleBlock.cpp) & [Sign.hpp](https://github.com/SPHINX-HUB-ORG/SPHINX-HUB/blob/main/src/Sign.hpp)

The `SPHINXSign` and `SPHINXMerkleBlock` namespace leverages the power of Merkle trees based on the state-of-the-art [SPHINCS+](https://sphincs.org/) principle, which emerged as the 4th winner in the "Post-Quantum" cryptography competition held by the National Institute of Standards and Technology ([NIST](https://www.nist.gov/publications/breaking-category-five-sphincs-sha-256)).

SPHINCS+ (Stateless PHotonic Isogeny-based Signature Scheme) is a groundbreaking hybrid signature scheme that combines robust hash-based, code-based, and isogeny-based cryptographic components. Its primary goal is to achieve two critical properties: `statelessness` and `post-quantum` security.

In the advent of quantum computers, which have the potential to render traditional cryptographic algorithms vulnerable, the elimination or reduction of reliance on state becomes imperative. Quantum computers, with their ability to exist in multiple states simultaneously, pose significant risks to storing sensitive content in state. The concept of `statelessness` in SPHINCS+ aims to mitigate these risks by eliminating the reliance on state, providing resilience against attacks by powerful quantum computers.

Unlike alternative post-quantum digital signature algorithms such as [Crystals-dilithium](https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/) which offer high levels of security but are susceptible to "side-channel attacks", side channel atttack means attack on devices, the bad actors can attack on devices to found the "Sign" then it can to used to sign any message that their want, our decision to employ SPHINCS+ as the foundation for our Merkle tree scheme and digital signature scheme ensures both the robustness against quantum adversaries and resistance to side-channel attacks.

With the `SPHINXMerkleBlock` namespace, we empower developers to harness the advanced capabilities of SPHINCS+ and build secure, future-proof applications that can withstand the challenges posed by the dawn of the quantum era.

We know that Hash-Based digital signature scheme is not lattice-based and relly on the strengthness of the hash-function, thats why our default [SPHINXHash](https://github.com/ChyKusuma/SPHINXHash) hash function is based on SWIFFTX which is rely on "Lattice-based", here our purposed is try to achieve both `Statelessness` and `Lattice-based` together at once.

Digital signature scheme like [Gottesman-chuang](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2186040_Quantum_Digital_Signatures) its trully guarantee by Quantum-Laws, we aware about that, but it's still too expensive technology, its needed new infrastructure, new hardware, a lot of money will only spent into infrastructure, so for today its not solution for us and not applicable. One day, when the world already build the quantum infrastructure i.e Quantum Key Distribution we believed our construction will more safe.
